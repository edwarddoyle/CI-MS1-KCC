## Overview

>The Kilmacow Community Clean-up (KCC) page was developed to provide visitors with an overview of the events and activities carried out by the KCC. The KCC group currently advertises their events and activities in a local newsletter (digital and print) and through their social media channels. Recently KCC members have raised concerns over attendance figures at their events. It was identified that the decrease was due to previous attendees not having access to information about dates and times of events, as many of them were not on social media. A website was proposed to solve this issue. The KCC outlined simplicity and accessibility to be the core features of the website. The website would need to work on both mobile and desktop as the age of members ranged from 5 years old to 80 years old.

### Surface

#### Colours

>![font](assets/docs/font.png) #00202a is the main font colour. The client requested the text colour in the logo be used, however, the logo font colour did not provide enough contrast against the white background. #00202a is half way between black and the logo font colour.

>The client requested a clean colour scheme on the website. White was chosen as the predominant colour with highlights provided by shadows and hints of colours taken from the client's logo. The main colours of the logo are:

#### Typography

>The font used throughout the website is Atkinson Hyperlegible, with Sans-Serif used as a fallback. The font weight and font size css attributes are used with the font for emphasis and hierarchy. Atkinson Hyperlegible was chosen, as it focuses on letterform distinction to increase character recognition, ultimately improving readability.
